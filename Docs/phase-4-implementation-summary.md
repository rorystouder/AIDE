                     ↓                 ↓                    ↓
              Track Statistics   Apply Strategy      Suggest Actions
```

### Deployment Pipeline
```
Push/PR → Test (9 environments) → Build → Security Scan → Quality Check
                                    ↓
                              Preview Build (PR)
                                    or
